            <p>
                My kindergarten years at <b>Tabika Kemas Pandan Indah Fasa 2B</b> were my first introduction to learning and discovery, filled with moments that would set the stage for my love of education. Located conveniently near my grandparents' house, it quickly became a second home—a place where friendships were made, creativity was sparked, and new skills were learned every day.

                    <span>Age 5 - First Steps</span>
                    <p>At five years old, I took my first steps into the classroom. Nervous at first, I soon found a world of colors, stories, and games that made learning feel like play.</p>
            
                    <span>Acting Debut - "Kind-hearted Tree Feller"</span>
                    <p>I proudly represented my kindergarten in a local acting competition. I played the role of a kind-hearted tree feller, and to my surprise, we won first place! This experience helped me build confidence and discover a love for storytelling.</p>
                
                    <span>Final Exam - First Place</span>
                    <p>By the end of the year, I was thrilled to receive the first-place award in my final exams, a reward for all the hard work and excitement that the year had brought.</p>
               
                    <span>Making Friends and Learning Together</span>
                    <p>Kindergarten was where I learned to make friends, share toys, and work as a team—important lessons that I still carry with me today.</p>
