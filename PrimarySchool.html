            <p>
                My primary school years were filled with valuable learning experiences and personal growth. From the age of 7 to 12, I began my education journey at <strong>Sekolah Kebangsaan Pandan Indah</strong> for the first month. Soon after, I transferred to <strong>Sekolah Kebangsaan Bandar Rinching</strong>, where I would spend the rest of my primary school years.
